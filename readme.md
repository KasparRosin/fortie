# Fortie

A simple [Fortnox](https://www.fortnox.se/) PHP package, including Laravel Service Provider for easy integration in Laravel.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this package is through Composer.

```
composer require wetcat/fortie dev-master
```

Or add `"wetcat/fortie": "dev-master"` to your `composer.json`.

If you don't have Composer you should [install it](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

## Configuration

In Laravel you change use the published configuration file found at `config/fortie.php`, it should look something like the following. Fill this in with the details provided by Fortnox when you signed up.

The **Access Token** is not provided when signing up, you need to get that seperately using your **Auth Code** and **Client Secret**. Read more about this process [here](http://developer.fortnox.se/documentation/general/authentication/).

```php
<?php 

return [

  'default' => [

    // Your specific access token
    'access_token'   => '<your access token>',

    // Your specific client secret
    'client_secret'  => '<your client secret>',

    // The type you're sending
    'content_type'   => 'application/json',

    // The type you're accepting as response
    'accepts'        => 'application/json', 

    // The URL to the Fortnox API
    'endpoint'       => 'https://api.fortnox.se/3/',

  ],

];
```

Note that XML is not fully supported yet, the package can read and will attempt to translate the responses from Fortnox into XML structures, but when sending data to Fortnox it will always send in json.

## Usage

### Configuration

### Access tokens

To get an access token (for use with your integration) you need to request it using a `authroization-code`.

In Laravel you can use the Artisan command to easily get the access token.

```
php artisan fortie:activate code=<your authorization code>
```

### Providers

The package is set up with multiple providers, each provider is mapped towards a specific endpoint in the REST api. For example **accounts** are mapped to the **accounts()** method.

```php
$arrayOfAccounts = $fortie->accounts()->all();
```

For details on the usage of all providers you should consult [the Wiki](https://github.com/wetcat-studios/fortie/wiki).
